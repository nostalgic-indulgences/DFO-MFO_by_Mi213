# DFO/MFO Redesign by Mi213

Since the original gerber design files are all hosted on the circuitboard forums, I have decided to host the files here for easy assess. Thanks once again to @Mi213 for his contribution to the open community with his elegant and flatter take on the DFOs and MFO. They are all zipped up in the gerber directories for easy pcb ordering at your preferred vendor.

I have included the pre-made TI Hex files that are posted on the circuitboard forums by @micro for easy consolidated access as well.
